* NetEase Music Library for Emacs
  
** Installnation
1. If you use melpa, install emms from melpa. But melpa is blocked in China, so please use elpa-emacs-china instead.

2. Download music.el from github and add this file to your load-path.
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "your-path-to-netease-music.el")
   #+END_SRC

3. Get YOUR-USER-ID.
   You need to request this url: http://119.23.207.231:3000/login/cellphone?phone=YOUR-PHONE-NUMBER&password=YOUR-PASSWORD.
   Replace YOUR-PHONE-NUMBER with your real phone number(China) and YOUR-PASSWORD with your real password.

   Get  YOUR-USER-ID from 'account'. Just like this.

6. Improve sound quality.
   
   When I listen songs in my machine, the sound quality was so bad, and I knew the song's quality was perfect. So if you have the same problem, you can install [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]] and [[https://github.com/dochang/emms-player-mpv][emms-player-mpv]]. Use mpv to play songs.
